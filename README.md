# Ind_Project_New-Topic-Analysis-Classification--Kaggle
Independent Project - Kaggle Dataset-- I worked with the News Category Dataset, which provided a headline and description, etc. in .json format; used NLTK for NLP, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and finding part-of-speech; trained and tuned parameters on classifier models to predict news category based on headline text.
